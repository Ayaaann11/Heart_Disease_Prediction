The notebook includes the following steps:


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The author explores the dataset's features, such as age, sex, cp (chest pain type), and chol (serum cholesterol). The analysis also includes a visualization of the correlation matrix and the distribution of various features in relation to the target variable.


Model Fitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate three different classification models.


Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy score of 84.21%.


Decision Tree: Achieved an accuracy score of 81.58%.


Random Forest: Achieved the highest accuracy score of 88.16%.


Data preprocessing: The author uses StandardScaler() to scale the features.
